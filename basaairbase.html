        <h3>Cesar Basa Air Base</h3>

        <p>Basa Air Base, situated approximately 40 miles northwest of the Philippine capital, serves as the Headquarters of the Philippine Air Force's Air Defense Wing. Notably, recent upgrades have bolstered its infrastructure, including a 10,000-foot runway, a development financed by the United States under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Of the original $82 million EDCA allocation, $66 million was dedicated to projects on Basa Air Base. EDCA initiatives also include construction of a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) warehouse, command and control centers, and fuel depots. Additionally, U.S. investments under the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) extends to the construction of a $35 million parking apron adjacent to the northwest end of the runway, facilitating parking for 18 small and 2 large aircraft. While the base is utilized primarily by the the Philippines sole fighter squadron, comprising 12 FA-50PH Fighting Eagles, the upgraded runway and expanded parking apron will enable the base to accommodate a broader spectrum of airframes, including heavier transport aircraft.</p>

        <p>These upgrades at Basa Air Base significantly enhance the United States capacity to project power in the Western Pacific. Upon completion of the runway upgrade and parking apron expansion, the base will be capable of hosting any aircraft within the U.S. Air Force's inventory. Strategically situated with Scarborough Shoal located 300 km to the west and Taiwan 800 km to the North, Basa Air Base, along with the larger Clark Air Base nearby, offers an ideal operational vantage point. It is likely that the United States will facilitate the prepositioning of fuel and equipment on this base, as well as utilize it as a staging point for U.S. aircraft that may be tasked with supporting contingency operations in the event of crises situations in Taiwan or the South China Sea.</p>
