<p>Fort Magsaysay, located in Nueva Ecija province and under the administration of the Philippine Army, stands as the largest military reservation in the country. It serves as the home of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' (AFP) National Training Center and Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Notably, the United States has provided $11.4 million for various projects, including a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) warehouse, command and control infrastructure, and urban combat training venues. Additionally, the United States and Philippine military forces utilize this installation for joint training exercises in “remote, rugged, and austere environments.” U.S. forces likely leverage the expertise of their Philippine counterparts in jungle warfare and use such exercises to acclimatize their troops and equipment to tropical conditions, a departure from their recent operational landscapes dominated by desert environments in Iraq or mountainous terrains in Afghanistan over the past twenty-five years.</p>
