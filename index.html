        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>In April 2023, the United States and Philippines announced the expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), a pivotal security pact aimed at enhancing regional stability and addressing shared security challenges. Through EDCA, the United States gains access to strategic bases in the Philippines, facilitating joint military training exercises, disaster relief operations, infrastructure development, and support to modernize the Philippine armed forces. On top of the five original sites, the expansion granted the United States military access to an additional four new sites, strategically located to bolster regional security and address emerging threats, particularly in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. China perceives EDCA as a challenge to its regional ambitions and has responded with condemnation, leveraging political, media, and economic influence to undermine the agreement. As tensions escalate in the South China Sea and across the Taiwan Strait, the future trajectory of U.S.-Philippines relations and the effectiveness of EDCA in shaping regional dynamics remain subjects of ongoing analysis and debate.</p>

        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>This Intelligence Estimate seeks to conduct a comprehensive examination of each Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) site, focusing on their individual capabilities and potential applications. Subsequently, it will evaluate the role of EDCA within the broader framework of United States strategic objectives in the Indo-Pacific region. Furthermore, this assessment will analyze the implications of EDCA from the perspective of the People's Republic of China (PRC), exploring potential responses to the recent expansion of the agreement.</p>

        <h3>Key Judgements</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The EDCA sites are likely to play a crucial role in enhancing the U.S.'s strategic posture in the Indo-Pacific region.</li>
                <li>The U.S.'s increasing reliance on partners to promote mutual interests in the Indo-Pacific region likely signals a tacit acceptance of the end of a unipolar world order.</li>
                <li>China will almost certainly view EDCA as part of a U.S. strategy of containment and further attempts by an outsider to meddle in regional and internal affairs.</li>
                <li>China will likely respond to the EDCA announcement and growing ties between the United States and the Philippines with official announcements of condemnation, political and media influence campaigns, economic coercion, and increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.</li>

        <h3>Original EDCA Sites (2014)</h3>
        <p>After the original agreement was signed in 2014, U.S. and Philippine defense officials identified five locations that would be designated EDCA sites.</p>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Expanded EDCA Sites (2023)</h3>
        <p>In April 2023, the Philippines and United States announced that the U.S. military would be granted access to four additional sites as part of plans to expand the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement.</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Naval Base Camilo Osias</li>
